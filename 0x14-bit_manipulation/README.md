Tasks
0. 0(mandatory):
Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);

1. 1(mandatory):
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);

2. 10(mandatory):
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);

3. 11(mandatory):
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

4. 100(mandatory):
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);

5. 101(mandatory):
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);

6. Endianness(advanced):
Write a function that checks the endianness.
Prototype: int get_endianness(void);

7. Crackme3(advanced):
Find the password for this program.
Save the password in the file 101-password
Your file should contain the exact password, no new line, no extra space
